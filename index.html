        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              This  paper  shall  describe  the  development  process  of  a  project  which  will devise 
              a prototype called "ISEIS" also known as IOT Smart Egg Incubation System. It is a device 
              which simulates an incubator by keeping eggs warm with the appropriate humidity using Arduino 
              platform for the reason to hatch the eggs.
              
              <br><br>The egg hatching incubator machine is equipped with DHT22 (Temperature and humidity) sensor, 
              Heating elements, humidifier, fans that able to automatically monitor and 2 regulate the inside 
              environment of the incubator is in the ideal condition to incubate eggs. 
              The entire system will be controlled using NODEMCU (Arduino control system) as the brain of 
              the system. The system has a LCD display and user buttons for user customization on site and 
              an andriod application for the wireless monitoring and control via a remote server (Google Firebase).
